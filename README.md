## What is Crontab?
The Cron daemon is a service that runs on all main distributions of Unix and Linux. Specifically designed to execute commands at a given time. These jobs are commonly refered as cronjobs and are one of the essential tools that should be present in every Systems Administrator's tool box. Cronjobs are used for automating tasks or scripts so that they can be executed at specific time.

```

#### To Generate a log file
##### To store the cron output in a file, use the closing bracket (>) again:
```
10 * * * * /usr/bin/php /www/virtual/username/script.py > /var/log/cron.log
```
##### That will rewrite the output file every time. If you would like to append the output at the end of the file without a complete rewrite, use double closing bracket (>>) instead of single(>):
```
10 * * * * /usr/bin/php /www/virtual/username/script.py >> /var/log/cron.log
```
